Here is a small tech demo that shows off a text adventure game written on a forked copy of impress.js

Steps are replaced with scenes. Each scene has a location within a 3D matrix.  
These locations are then translated into the impress.js coordinates.

The arrow keys are mapped to move through this space instead of simply progressing in file order.

Features include auto progress "action" scenes and one-way "exit" scenes that always exit by a single path.
